# Backend CI/CD Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Virtual Environment Usage (Critical Fix)**

**Problem**: CI tests were installing dependencies globally instead of using virtual environment
**Solution**:

- Added virtual environment creation and activation in all CI steps
- All dependency installations now happen within the virtual environment
- All test commands now run within the activated virtual environment

### 2. **Path Navigation Issues**

**Problem**: Deployment script was navigating to wrong directory on EC2
**Solution**:

- Fixed navigation path from `cd /home/ubuntu/LeetTrack` to `cd LeetTrack/backend`
- Added proper git operations at repository root level
- Ensured all backend operations happen in the correct directory

### 3. **Missing Gunicorn Dependency**

**Problem**: Deployment tried to use gunicorn but it wasn't in requirements.txt
**Solution**:

- Added `gunicorn==21.2.0` to requirements.txt
- Added gunicorn installation in CI workflow
- Ensured gunicorn is available in both CI and deployment environments

### 4. **Log Directory and Permissions Issues**

**Problem**: Gunicorn config referenced system paths that required special permissions
**Solution**:

- Updated gunicorn.conf.py to use relative paths (`logs/access.log`, `logs/error.log`)
- Changed PID file to relative path (`leettrack.pid`)
- Added automatic logs directory creation in deployment script

### 5. **Environment Variable Handling**

**Problem**: Flask commands were run without proper environment setup
**Solution**:

- Added proper environment variable exports before Flask commands
- Set `FLASK_APP=app.py` and `FLASK_ENV=production` in deployment
- Ensured consistent environment setup across all operations

### 6. **Cache Path Configuration**

**Problem**: GitHub Actions cache was using incorrect path
**Solution**:

- Fixed cache dependency path to `backend/requirements.txt`

## Files Modified

### 1. `.github/workflows/backend-deploy.yml`

- ✅ Added virtual environment creation and activation in CI
- ✅ Fixed EC2 navigation paths
- ✅ Added gunicorn installation
- ✅ Added logs directory creation
- ✅ Improved environment variable handling
- ✅ Fixed cache dependency path

### 2. `backend/requirements.txt`

- ✅ Added `gunicorn==21.2.0` for production server

### 3. `backend/gunicorn.conf.py`

- ✅ Changed log paths to relative (`logs/access.log`, `logs/error.log`)
- ✅ Changed PID file to relative path (`leettrack.pid`)
- ✅ Removed system-level permissions requirements

### 4. `backend/setup_dev.sh` (New File)

- ✅ Created development setup script that mirrors CI/CD process
- ✅ Provides consistent local development environment
- ✅ Includes virtual environment, dependency installation, and logs directory creation

## Key Improvements

### **Consistency**

- Same virtual environment approach used in CI, deployment, and local development
- Consistent dependency management across all environments

### **Reliability**

- Proper error handling and path validation
- Reduced permission-related deployment failures
- Better logging and debugging capabilities

### **Maintainability**

- Clear separation of concerns in deployment steps
- Easier to debug and troubleshoot issues
- Consistent environment setup

## Testing

The fixes have been tested with:

- ✅ Local development setup script runs successfully
- ✅ Virtual environment creation and activation works
- ✅ Dependencies install correctly including gunicorn
- ✅ Logs directory is created automatically
- ✅ Health endpoint is available at `/api/health`

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the changes**: Push to main branch to trigger the updated CI/CD
2. **Monitor deployment**: Check that the new workflow runs successfully
3. **Verify health check**: Ensure the API responds correctly at `https://api.leettrack.app/api/health`
4. **Log monitoring**: Check that logs are being written to the new relative paths

## Health Check Endpoint

The workflow expects a health check at `/api/health` which already exists and returns:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "LeetTrack API is running",
  "database": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Development Usage

For local development, developers can now use:

```bash
cd backend
./setup_dev.sh
```

This will set up the exact same environment as used in CI/CD, ensuring consistency across all environments.
